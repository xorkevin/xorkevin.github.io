      <description>As the amount of projects I have worked on grew, I noticed that many requirements were similar if not identical across them. Not only was rewriting code tedious every time I needed a similar feature, but also remembering how to back-port new implementations for existing features as I learned more about the corresponding subjects was tedious. This often involved (and for my older projects this is still the case) viewing diffs among various commits for the new feature to determine how the implementation changed.</description>
