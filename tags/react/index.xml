      <description>Nuke was designed as a frontend for the Governor web framework project. I wanted to build a UI that could facilitate testing the numerous services that compose Governor. However, as the project grew, I wanted to also componentize various UI elements for future reuse. Thus, Nuke became its own UI library, which I have since used in many other projects, including the LAHacks application system, UCLA DevX internal tooling dashboard, and this blog itself.</description>
